# What I learned
This repository represents a simple android application from a practical I found on [codelabs.developers.google.com](https://codelabs.developers.google.com)

I was building this app while following the practical and some of the things I learned include:
- How to use both the drag and drop designer and the XML designer to create the user interface.
- What are views, how to edit the view's attributes, how to extract the text from a text view.
- How to add on click events to views and buttons, how to display toast messages.
- How to use and manipulate the constraint layout, how to extract colors and strings as resources.
- What are intents, how to create an activity and use extras to communicate between activities, how switch from one activity to another.
